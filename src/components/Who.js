                I learned a lot from different technologies, but my favorite expertise is in <strong>React.js, HTML,
                 SCSS, Bootstrap, Gatsby, Javascript, Advance Python, TensorFlow, Keras,</strong> and much <strong>more</strong>.
                  with these technologies you can see my some Projects given below...
                </h5>
            
                    <h2>who<span style={{ marginLeft:'10px', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Iam</span></h2>
               

            </div>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Who
